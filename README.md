**ðŸš¨Note: The original Haven OnDemand service is not currently operational. This package will NOT workðŸš¨**

While Daven OnDemand is down, this package will no longer work. If MicroFocus (the buyer of Haven OnDemand) provides support for the original Haven OnDemand again, I will update this module accordingly, to get it working again.

In the meantime, [IBM Watson](https://www.ibm.com/watson), [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/cognitive-services/text-analytics/) and [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/) offers similar  text analysis products, and are free to use for small / personal projects.

Alternativley if it's just sentiment analysis your after, I have written my own stand-alone, AFINN-111 based package, here: [sentiment-analysis](https://github.com/Lissy93/sentiment-analysis). Hope that helps!
